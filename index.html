                        I like to run around and smell things. I also like to eat poop sometimes. I like to roll over. I also eat lots of yummy things. I am dog. Bella is my name. I don't have any friends because I smell bad. I'm also really mean and dusty. I bark at everyone. But I am also a philosopher. I like to think about bones and barking and growling and slobbering and dust. I also shed a lot. The place I live is covered in fur. It is everywhere. My slaves are also covered in my fur. They give me brown <span id=phraseFix> substance to eat. It smells yummy sometimes.</span>

                        Sometimes they give me extra yummy things. But not regularly because I am a little chunky. I am also very dusty.
